"""Real numerical eager-vs-graph parity check for
``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph`` (qo_len=1) -- NOT signal-probe. Built per an
explicit coordinator requirement, following an independent (Codex)
correctness review that found the earlier signal-probe-only verification
insufficient to catch GDN state pollution: this project's own identity-
recall task is plausibly dominated by full-attention layers' copy
mechanism, masking a GDN-specific perturbation a more GDN-sensitive task
might not tolerate.

This test drives the SAME real input (identical prompt, identical
kv_len, identical draft token) through TWO independent, identically
prefilled physical-slot groups:
  - ``eager_slots``: the already-verified single-call
    ``DirectModelRunner._forward_batch`` path (no CUDA graph at all).
  - ``graph_slots``: ``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph.replay()``.

and compares, directly and numerically:
  1. Full output logits -- max abs diff, cosine similarity, and
     ``torch.allclose`` at a generous-but-meaningful tolerance (eager
     uses a per-call, TIGHT kv_split_size; the graph uses a build-time
     FIXED, larger one -- see build_attention_metadata_batch's docstring
     -- so a different attention split/merge reduction order is
     EXPECTED to introduce some floating-point noise, the same
     "different shape/path -> different rounding" phenomenon already
     established for batch-composition effects. The check here is that
     the difference stays SMALL, not that it's exactly zero).
  2. Top-1/top-5 predicted token id agreement.
  3. The GDN recurrent state tensors themselves (``conv_state``/
     ``ssm_state``, read directly out of ``runner.kv_caches`` for the
     physical row each group's slot maps to) -- for a SINGLE token at
     IDENTICAL input, GDN's own math does not depend on attention's
     kv_split_size at all, so eager and graph should agree here far
     more tightly than the logits comparison. This is the single most
     direct test for the "capture's warmup polluted the real GDN state"
     bug class this round's fix targets: a real state-neutral capture
     should show these tensors bytewise-identical (or extremely close);
     a regression would show them meaningfully diverged even though the
     signal-probe-level text output might still look fine.
