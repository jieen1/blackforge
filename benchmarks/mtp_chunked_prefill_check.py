"""Dedicated correctness test for chunked prefill (2026-07-19,
``notes/2026-07-18-session-review-and-next-steps.md`` section 19).

This is the single most important check for this round's work: chunked
prefill's whole point is to carry GDN's recurrent ``conv_state``/
``ssm_state`` correctly across chunks of the SAME slot's own prefill (a
mode this runtime's underlying primitives already generally supported --
``build_gdn_metadata_batch``'s ``has_initial_state``, ``_forward_batch``'s
``kv_lengths``/``commit`` -- but had never actually been exercised this
way before). A bug here is SILENT STATE CORRUPTION, not a crash: if
``has_initial_state`` were wrong (e.g. always False, effectively
"forgetting" every earlier chunk's context), the model would still
produce SOME output, just a wrong one conditioned on only the last
chunk's own local content -- exactly the failure mode this project's own
CLAUDE.md flags as the dangerous one for GDN state work.

Four checks, in increasing scope:

0. **Chunked-vs-non-chunked equivalence** (the core gate): the SAME
   16384-token prompt is prefilled FOUR ways in the SAME process --
   ``chunk_size=None`` (today's single-shot path, unchanged), 4 chunks
   (``chunk_size=4096``), 2 chunks (``chunk_size=8192``, this project's
   own suggested default, matching native vLLM's
   ``--max-num-batched-tokens``), and 16 chunks (``chunk_size=1024``, a
   deliberately more-aggressive stress case with far more chunk
   boundaries). Anchor token and all K draft tokens are compared across
   all four -- a real state-carryover bug (e.g. ``has_initial_state``
   wrong, effectively "forgetting" earlier chunks) would be expected to
   produce a LARGE divergence (a different anchor entirely, likely
   growing worse with MORE chunks), not "close but not bit-exact."

1. **GDN state tensor comparison** (diagnostic, root-caused, not a hard
   gate -- see below): ``conv_state``/``ssm_state`` for every GDN layer,
   compared directly between the four prefill variants' own physical
   slots. **A real, measurable, source-grounded numerical effect WAS
   found and root-caused this round** (see the writeup in
   ``notes/2026-07-18-session-review-and-next-steps.md`` section 19):
   conv/ssm state is stored in the model's compute dtype (bf16 for this
   model, ``MambaStateDtypeCalculator.gated_delta_net_state_dtype``,
   ``mamba_cache_dtype="auto"``) -- every EXTERNAL chunk boundary this
   round introduces writes the running recurrent state out to this
   bf16-precision persistent buffer and reads it back for the next
   chunk, a real (if small) extra quantization step a single continuous
   forward call never pays (it keeps the accumulating state in the
   kernel's own higher-precision working representation throughout, only
   casting to bf16 once at the very end). A per-layer probe (this
   file's own diagnostic precursor, not committed) found this effect is
   EXACTLY ZERO at GDN layer 0 (the very first layer -- proving the
   read/write addressing itself is correct) and grows smoothly through
   the 48-layer GDN stack, the SAME qualitative "compounds through depth,
   starts as a tiny per-call discrepancy" signature this project already
   established for a DIFFERENT root cause (cross-slot bf16 batching
   order, ``notes/...`` section 10.5) -- not a new, unexplained failure
   mode. This is reported per-layer for the record (and gated only on
   "no NaN/Inf, no wildly-out-of-plausible-range blowup" -- a real
   structural bug would very likely violate even that loose bound), NOT
   held to a tight bytewise/allclose tolerance the way
   ``mtp_gdn_rollback_check.py`` correctly holds actual snapshot/restore
   to -- the two are different mechanisms (an exact copy vs. a
   mathematically-equivalent-but-differently-precision-quantized
   re-derivation), so a different standard for "passing" is correct here,
   exactly as this project's own ``mtp_ragged_recompute_verify_check.py``
   already established for a different genuinely-different-mechanism
   comparison (near-tie-tolerant, not bit-exact).

2. **Independent-mechanism cross-check**: a slot prefilled via the
   genuinely different singular (``mtp_prefill``/``_forward``/
   ``_mtp_sync_and_propose``, no ``_batch`` anywhere) code path -- a
   real, previously-established-correct reference outside the whole
   ``_forward_batch``/chunking family -- checked via the project's own
   near-tie-margin convention (``NEAR_TIE_LOGIT_MARGIN=2.0``), not
   exact-match (a batched-vs-singular divergence is an established,
   accepted noise class in this project, not a new tolerance invented
   for this check).

3. **Multi-round continuation**: CONTINUATION_ROUNDS real
   ``mtp_verify_and_commit_batch`` rounds run on all four chunked-family
   slots TOGETHER (batched), comparing each slot's generated continuation
   token-for-token -- catches a "looks fine right after prefill but
   drifts a few rounds later" class of bug that check 0 alone could miss,
   and gives the bf16-round-trip effect found in check 1 real additional
   rounds to compound further and potentially flip a real decision, if
   it were going to.

4. **Second, independent prompt**: the same non-chunked-vs-chunked
   anchor/draft-token exact-match gate as check 0, re-run on a real
   natural-language paragraph (tiled to ~8500 tokens, 3 chunks) instead
   of the synthetic sequential-token-id fixture -- guards against the
   synthetic fixture's own atypically-predictable content (and its
   degenerate repeated-token continuation once pushed past a natural
   stopping point, observed in check 3) masking a real divergence that
   only shows up on genuinely varied content.
