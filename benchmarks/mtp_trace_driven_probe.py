"""Sol Phase 1: trace-driven MTP scheduling-overhead probe.

Strictly time-boxed (per the coordinator's explicit instruction), NOT a
real drafter. There is no `Qwen3_5MTP` model loaded here and no real
proposal step -- the accept/reject outcome for every round/slot is a
SYNTHETIC, pre-generated trace (a fixed per-token acceptance probability
fed through a seeded RNG), decoupled from what any real draft model
would actually produce. What IS real: every GPU operation this script
drives is the actual, already-verified production mechanism -- a real
batched `verify_batch()` forward (qo_len=K+1, concurrency=4), real
`snapshot_gdn_state()`/`restore_gdn_state()`, and a real committed-length
recompute forward on any round a slot's trace outcome is a partial/full
reject. This directly fixes, for this script's own bookkeeping, the
code-level gap Codex-sol flagged in `_forward_batch()`/`verify_batch()`
(they advance `slot_kv_len` by the full `qo_len` unconditionally,
conflating "positions physically written speculatively" with "positions
actually committed") -- see the manual `slot_kv_len` correction below.

Purpose: measure ONLY control-plane/scheduling overhead -- GPU-busy time
(via CUDA events) vs. wall-clock time (via `time.perf_counter()`) across
a realistic MTP verify+rollback round shape -- to answer one question:
"once you remove Python/vLLM scheduling overhead, how much headroom is
actually available on the launch-gap/GPU-busy dimension?" If GPU-busy%
is already high here, the eventual full-drafter engineering investment
(see notes/direct-model-runner-design.md's worst-case redesign scope)
has correspondingly less to gain; if it's low, that's a concrete signal
the full integration is worth its cost.

**MANDATORY LABELING for every number this script prints**: any
"acceptance rate" or "accepted tokens/s" here is a CONTROLLED-TRACE
SCHEDULING-OVERHEAD UPPER-BOUND ESTIMATE, not a real MTP acceptance-rate
or performance conclusion, and does NOT substitute for the real W1/W2
acceptance-rate-gate comparison against native vLLM MTP (still pending,
blocked on real draft-model integration).
