"""Correctness verification for the CUDA-graph wiring into the REAL
``mtp_verify_and_commit_batch`` entry point (``runtime/direct_model_runner.py``),
per ``notes/2026-07-17-post-ragged-round-next-steps.md``'s Phase 3 (verify
forward + K-1 draft steps, then a fast-iteration follow-up round -- full
precapture and step-0 draft-resync generalization) and its Phase 2
(native spec-decode GDN path, then this round's CUDA-graph reconciliation
of that path).

**History, briefly**: Phase 3 (2026-07-17/18) built ``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph``
around the then-current chunked GDN metadata path, including a
"recompute-forward graph-reuse" special case (a SEPARATE recompute
forward, needed on every partial-reject round, could reuse the
verify-graph cache at whatever qo_len the ragged recompute group's
committed_len happened to be). Phase 2 (2026-07-18) rewrote
``mtp_verify_and_commit_batch`` to use the real spec-decode GDN mechanism
(``build_gdn_metadata_spec_batch`` -- K+1 dedicated SSM rows,
acceptance-aware addressing) and eliminated the separate recompute
forward ENTIRELY (every slot's hidden states, regardless of accept/
reject, are now a ragged slice of the ONE verify forward) -- but that
rewrite initially fell back to eager dispatch for the verify step itself,
since ``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph`` was still built for the old mechanism.
**This round** reconciles the two: ``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph``'s qo_len>1
branch now fills GDN metadata via the SAME spec-decode mechanism
(``static_spec_state_indices``/``static_num_accepted_tokens``, refilled
per replay from real slot ids/accept-reject outcomes -- see that class's
docstring), so verify-step CUDA-graph replay works again. Since there is
no more separate recompute forward at all (with or without graphs), the
old "recompute-forward graph-reuse" special case and its own
``qo_len in 1..k`` precapture range are GONE too -- verify now only ever
replays at exactly ``qo_len=k+1``, for every slot, every round,
regardless of accept/reject outcome.

Unlike ``cudagraph_eager_parity_check.py``/``cudagraph_mtp_regression.py``
(which drive ``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph`` directly via ``.capture()``/
``.replay()`` in isolation), this test constructs a runner with
``enable_cudagraph=True`` and drives the REAL production call path
(``mtp_prefill_batch`` -> repeated ``mtp_verify_and_commit_batch``) --
exercising every graph-or-eager dispatch decision inside that method and
``_mtp_sync_and_propose_batch``, not just the underlying primitives.

Methodology: the project's established "independent-reference-replay"
pattern (``mtp_batch_verify_check.py``/``mtp_ragged_recompute_verify_check.py``)
-- feed each round's REAL committed tokens into an independent single-slot
``_forward`` reference call every round, comparing its own greedy argmax
against the batched path's ``next_anchor`` within a near-tie tolerance.
This decouples one round's possible near-tie tie-break flip from
corrupting the next round's check, and needs only ONE model load (one
runner; ``ref_slots`` on the always-eager single-slot path serve as the
oracle for ``mtp_slots`` on the graph-enabled batched path).

Coverage, and which code path each round is designed to exercise:

0-1. Organic rounds -- whatever the model actually does (usually full
     accept given this project's ~72% measured per-position acceptance
     rate). Exercises the common-case verify-graph + step-0-graph +
     draft-step-graph path.
2.   Mixed forced-reject (2 of 4 slots) -- the SAME verify-graph replay
     covers both the organically-accepting and forced-reject slots in
     one call (no more per-outcome branching at all, graph or eager);
     the draft resync afterward still splits by each slot's own real
     committed_len.
3.   Fully ragged forced-reject (every slot rejects at a DIFFERENT
     position) -- confirms the single verify-graph replay handles a
     genuinely ragged accept/reject OUTCOME correctly even though the
     replay's own INPUT shape (qo_len=k+1) never varies.
4.   Organic again, immediately after a ragged-reject round -- confirms
     the verify graph's static buffers (especially the new
     ``static_num_accepted_tokens``, which must correctly reflect the
     PREVIOUS round's real per-slot outcome) are refilled correctly
     round to round, not left stale.
5.   Single-slot forced reject.
6.   UNIFORM forced-reject, committed_len=2 for all 4 slots -- exercises
     the draft model's OWN step-0 resync graph at qo_len=2
     (``_get_draft_step_graph(4, 2)``, unrelated to the target-model
     verify graph, which is unaffected by committed_len since it always
     replays at qo_len=k+1 regardless).
7.   UNIFORM forced-reject, committed_len=1 for all 4 slots -- same
     draft-step-graph coverage at qo_len=1.
Shrink.  Drop from 4 active slots to 2 (simulating some requests finishing
     early, the real W1-S tail pattern) -- confirms a SECOND (batch_size=2)
     verify graph and draft-step graph get captured/used correctly.

Also confirms, via ``replay_count`` (not just cache-key presence, which
precapture alone would already satisfy regardless of whether anything
ever replays that shape):
- the verify graph is actually replayed at both batch_size=4 and 2 --
  the real pass/fail gate this round restores (was informational-only
  between the Phase 2 rewrite and this round's reconciliation);
- the draft-model step-0 graph is actually replayed (the generalization
  that, during development, needed an explicit ``_MAX_DECODE_QO_LEN``
  guard -- mtp_prefill_batch's own step-0 call uses num_new_tokens=
  prompt_len, e.g. 4096, which is also "uniform" and would otherwise have
  been forced through the decode-kernel dispatch it was never validated
  for; this test's own prefill call is the direct regression check for
  that guard actually firing);
- the draft-model qo_len=1 continuation-step graph is actually replayed.
