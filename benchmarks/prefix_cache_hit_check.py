"""Cumulative load-bearing gate for prefix-cache P3.3 --
``benchmarks/prefix_cache_hit_check.py`` (the design's sec 5-P3 test,
``notes/2026-07-19-p3-implementation-plan.md`` "### P3.3 -- Dedicated test
slice"; ``notes/prefix-cache-design.md`` sec 4 invariants INV1-INV9, sec 6
risks R1-R10).

P3.3a unified ``mtp_prefill_with_cache`` into the ONE production prefill
entrypoint (persistent-hit + P2 fan-out + cold) and proved INV5 parity; this
gate proves EVERY prefix-cache invariant holds THROUGH that production
entrypoint, plus the two genuinely-new P3.3b coverage items (INV2 persistent-
hit signal-probe crosstalk across all 4 slots; INV8 mid-flight admission of a
hit slot alongside long-running slots).

One ``DirectModelRunner`` (``enable_block_table=True`` + ``enable_prefix_cache
=True`` + ``enable_persistent_prefix_cache=True``, MTP K=3, CUSTOM attention),
slots reused via ``_reset_all``/``reset_slot`` + ``_clear_persistent_cache``
between subtests to avoid repeated model loads. Subtests:

* ``inv1_*`` (INV1/INV4, carry over via the production entrypoint) -- cold-vs-
  hit near-tie at SEVERAL L (partial + full), 20+ MTP decode rounds, a
  natural-language AND a code prompt; hit anchor == cold anchor (exact) +
  decode equivalence + hit acceptance == cold acceptance. Reuses
  ``prefix_cache_persistent_hit_check._run_inv1_case`` (already drives
  ``mtp_prefill_with_cache``).
* ``inv2_persistent_signal_probe`` (INV2, NEW) -- 4 distinct cached prefixes
  (each its own per-slot marker token), reset, then admit 4 slots that each
  HIT a different cached prefix via ONE ``mtp_prefill_with_cache`` call, decode
  a short burst from each, assert each slot's text contains its OWN marker and
  NONE of the other 3 (zero leakage). Generalizes ``prefix_cache_fanout_check
  .inv2_signal_probe`` from same-round forks to PERSISTENT hits.
* ``inv3_mismatched_prefix`` (INV3, carry over) -- mismatched/mixed-length
  prefixes reuse EXACTLY the right depth (L = G <= A). Reuses
  ``prefix_cache_persistent_hit_check._run_inv3_mismatched_prefix``.
* ``inv5_hit_table_parity`` (INV5, re-confirm) -- eager-vs-graph parity with a
  hit-populated NON-CONTIGUOUS table, via ``cudagraph_eager_parity_check
  --single-run-hit-json`` in a subprocess (it builds its own runner; two 27B
  models cannot coexist on one GPU). Layer-0 GDN bytewise exact + logits
  cosine >= 0.99 + top-1.
* ``inv8_midflight_hit`` (INV8, NEW) -- start 2 slots decoding a long
  generation (several verify rounds in flight), THEN admit a fresh slot that
  HITS a cached prefix mid-flight; assert (a) the hit engages (L>0) and its
  anchor matches its cold reference; (b) the already-running slots' block
  tables are UNCHANGED by the admission and their committed tokens stay
  correct (near-tie vs cold references -- no disruption); (c) the hit slot's
  own decode is correct (near-tie vs cold). Generalizes
  ``mtp_async_arrival_check``'s mid-flight pattern + persistent_hit's near-tie.
* ``inv9_admission_under_pressure`` (INV9, carry over) -- admission under pool
  pressure forcing eviction with NO live (ref_cnt>0) block reclaimed. Reuses
  ``prefix_cache_eviction_check._run_admission_under_pressure``.
* ``evict_then_recompute`` (carry over) -- evict -> re-request -> clean cold
  recompute (tokens + anchor match the original). Reuses
  ``prefix_cache_eviction_check._run_evict_then_recompute``.
* ``flag_off_delegation`` (the "P3 changes nothing when off" half) -- with
  ``enable_persistent_prefix_cache=False``, ``mtp_prefill_with_cache``
  delegates to ``mtp_prefill_batch`` byte-for-byte (identical anchor + draft
  tokens). Lightweight delegation-equivalence assertion (the full headline
  bit-identical is re-run by the LEADER).
* ``flag_on_regression`` -- a small flag-on battery proving the flag-on path is
  regression-free: a cold (L=0) multi-slot batch through
  ``mtp_prefill_with_cache`` matches ``mtp_prefill_batch`` exactly (the cold
  path IS the P2 fan-out/cold path), and a no-cache-available hit attempt
  (cleared cache) falls back to cold cleanly (anchor matches the original
  cold).

Methodology reuse (do NOT reinvent): near-tie ``NEAR_TIE_LOGIT_MARGIN = 2.0``
per R6 for token/logit comparisons (NOT bytewise) EXCEPT the GDN-layer-0
addressing proof which is exact per R1; any GDN conv comparison across a
slot-reuse-after-decode is COMMITTED-rows-only (``committed = conv.shape[0] -
num_speculative_tokens`` -- ``notes/2026-07-20-cold-prefill-rootcause-plan.md``
sec 3 dead-spec-row artifact).

SCOPE NOTE (leader decision): the >=64K Pattern-B PERF hook is DEFERRED to
P3.4 (its natural home -- P3.4 owns all long-context correctness + perf). This
gate runs at the standard ~4K-or-less scale the existing checks use; it asserts
CORRECTNESS through the production entrypoint, not the long-context speedup.
