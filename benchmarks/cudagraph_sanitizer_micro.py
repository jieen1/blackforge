"""Smallest practical repro of CapturedBatchDecodeGraph capture + replay,
for running under compute-sanitizer specifically. Even the "minimal"
10-call repro (cudagraph_decode_sanitizer_repro.py, batch_size=4) proved
impractically slow under full memcheck (multi-hour stalls); this cuts
further:

  - batch_size=2 instead of 4 (the persistent-buffer/kv_split_size
    mechanism being checked doesn't depend on batch size -- 4-slot
    correctness is already independently verified via extensive
    uninstrumented testing in cudagraph_decode_regression.py, 3/3 PASS
    including a case near this test's own configured per-slot page-table
    limit, not a GPU hardware limit).
  - Exactly ONE replay, directly at an extreme (near-capacity) kv_len --
    the single most decisive check (capture-time shape vs a drastically
    different replay-time shape) -- instead of a small-shape sanity
    replay followed by an extreme one.

Total forward-pass-equivalent calls: 2 prefills + 3 warmup + 1
capture-trace + 1 replay = 7 (vs the fuller repro's 10, vs the full
regression test's 21).

Run with --tool initcheck (lighter than memcheck, targets uninitialized-
memory/invalid-pointer issues -- the exact class of the sibling project's
documented illegal-memory-access history) and
--kernel-name-exclude kernel_substring=causal_conv1d (this project's own
pre-existing, already-investigated Triton cold-start defect, unrelated to
CUDA graphs, otherwise floods the report budget before ever reaching the
code under test -- see notes/direct-model-runner-design.md's "Known
independent defects").
