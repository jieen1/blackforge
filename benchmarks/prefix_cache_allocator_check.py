"""Correctness gate for prefix-cache P1 -- dynamic free-list allocator +
reference counting (``notes/prefix-cache-design.md`` sec 5, "P1 -- Dynamic
free-list allocator + reference counting").

P1 replaces P0's ``_initial_block_table`` static per-slot partition (every
logical slot pre-populated with its own fixed contiguous ``blocks_per_slot``
range, byte-identical to the old arange addressing) with a real
``BlockPool``: one shared free queue + ``ref_cnt`` bookkeeping over every
physical block except reserved block 0 (INV7). Slots now grow their own
``block_table[slot]`` ON DEMAND (``DirectModelRunner._ensure_blocks``,
called from every attention-metadata/slot-mapping/CUDA-graph-fill call
site) and release blocks back to the pool on ``reset_slot``/
``_finish_request`` -- still with **no cross-slot sharing** this phase
(every block has exactly one referencer), so end-to-end request/response
*behavior* stays identical to P0; only physical block *placement* becomes
genuinely dynamic (a single slot's own blocks may end up non-contiguous
over time). This is the design doc's own explicit purpose for this phase:
prove the block-table + CUDA-graph path tolerates non-contiguous block
ids, not just P0's trivial contiguous case.

This script is pure Python -- **no GPU, no model load** -- both because
the design doc scopes this dedicated test to the ALLOCATOR's own
invariants (real end-to-end model/logits correctness under P1's dynamic
addressing is covered elsewhere: ``prefix_cache_block_table_check.py``'s
numeric-equivalence re-run, the two fragmented-CUDA-graph re-runs of
``cudagraph_decode_regression.py``/``mtp_verify_cudagraph_check.py``, and
the full ``mtp_*_check`` battery + 4K/c=4 headline -- see
``notes/prefix-cache-implementation-log.md``'s P1 section for that
evidence), and because ``BlockPool.allocate``/``free`` and
``DirectModelRunner._ensure_blocks``/``reset_slot``'s block-freeing logic
are pure bookkeeping with zero GPU/tensor operations. ``_ensure_blocks``/
``reset_slot`` are exercised here as the REAL, unmodified, production
bound methods (called against a lightweight duck-typed stand-in object
that only defines the handful of attributes those two methods actually
touch) -- not a reimplementation of their logic -- so this is a genuine
test of the production code path, just isolated from the (expensive,
GPU-bound) model/tensor machinery those methods' CALLERS also touch.

Checks, each mapped to the design doc's own P1 test list and correctness
invariants (sec 4):

1. ``_check_alloc_free_correctness`` -- ``BlockPool.allocate``/``free``
   round-trip: ids returned are distinct, in range, excluding reserved;
   free returns them to the pool; over-allocation raises; double-free
   raises.
2. ``_check_ref_cnt_bookkeeping`` -- ``Block.ref_cnt`` goes 0->1 on
   allocate, 1->0 on free, and a block can be correctly re-allocated
   (0->1 again) after being freed once.
3. ``_check_free_queue_ordering`` -- P3.2 LRU eviction ordering of the
   intrusive ``FreeBlockQueue`` (vLLM ``free_blocks`` order): hashless
   freed blocks are prepended to the evict-next front (reclaimed before
   any cached block, newest-free-call first); hashed (cached) freed
   blocks are appended to the LRU tail (oldest-freed-first among them);
   hashless are always evicted before hashed. (P1's plain-FIFO deque
   behavior was intentionally superseded by this eviction policy in
   P3.2; see ``BlockPool``/``FreeBlockQueue`` docstrings.)
4. ``_check_inv7_reserved_block_zero`` -- block 0 (and, generally, every
   id ``< reserved``) is never handed out by ``allocate`` and never
   accepted by ``free``, across many allocate/free cycles, and the pool
   refuses to be constructed with ``reserved < 1``.
5. ``_check_append_only_growth`` (INV6) -- ``DirectModelRunner
   ._ensure_blocks`` only ever APPENDS to ``block_table[slot]``: an
   already-assigned logical position's physical block id never changes
   across repeated/idempotent/growing calls, and the capacity check
   (``> blocks_per_slot`` pages) still raises before ever touching the
   pool.
6. ``_check_reset_slot_frees_blocks`` -- the real ``DirectModelRunner
   .reset_slot`` releases every block a slot held back to the pool
   (``ref_cnt`` back to 0, re-enters the free queue) and clears
   ``block_table[slot]`` to ``[]`` -- the design doc's R10 risk-register
   entry this phase is required to close.
7. ``_check_fragmentation_after_churn`` -- the actual scenario P1 exists
   to prove safe: after an explicit allocate/reset/reallocate churn cycle
   (one slot's blocks freed and reallocated interleaved with another
   slot's own growth), a single slot's ``block_table`` entry is
   PROVABLY non-contiguous (not a contiguous arithmetic run) -- directly
   asserted here, not just claimed. (The model-level, CUDA-graph-replay
   proof that this fragmented state still produces correct output is the
   job of the two dedicated fragmented-CUDA-graph re-runs named in the
   design doc's P1 test list, not this script.)
