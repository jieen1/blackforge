"""Diagnostic for hypothesis (1) in the coordinator's remaining-8.7x-gap
investigation: is the cross-slot batched MTP coordinator ACTUALLY fully
batched in practice, or does something make it silently degrade back
toward per-slot execution?

``mtp_verify_and_commit_batch`` always batches the VERIFY step across
every active slot, but its post-verify draft catch-up+propose step only
batches the FULL-ACCEPT subgroup -- any slot with a partial reject
("needs-recompute") falls back to the EXISTING single-slot path
(``_forward_batch([slot],...)`` + ``_mtp_sync_and_propose(slot,...)``,
called once per affected slot, in a Python loop). The design doc's own
stated assumption when this was built was "batch the common case
(full-accept), fall back for the uncommon case (recompute)" -- this
script directly measures whether recompute is actually uncommon at the
W1-S shape's real ~68% draft acceptance rate, and whether recompute-heavy
rounds are disproportionately expensive (the two things needed to confirm
or refute that assumption).

For every real ``mtp_verify_and_commit_batch`` round on the W1-S fixture
(same n16/max_tokens=256/concurrency=4 shape as the perf comparison),
records: how many of the round's active slots needed recompute
(0..concurrency), and this round's total wall-clock time. Reports the
round-count histogram by recompute-slot-count and the mean/total
wall-clock time per bucket -- if recompute-heavy rounds are common AND
disproportionately slow, that is direct, decisive evidence of where a
chunk of the remaining gap lives (not requiring ncu/nsys to establish
this specific point, though nsys is still useful for the kernel-level
breakdown of what stays after this cause is quantified).
