"""Frozen serving workload definitions.

2026-07-17 extension (Codex-sol review, via the coordinator): the original
Phase 0 contract (below, kept unchanged for `W1`/`W2` -- `tests/test_workloads
.py` pins their `input_tokens`/`concurrency`) only carried length and
concurrency. That is not enough to make an acceptance-rate/throughput
comparison reproducible: an earlier round's W1 acceptance-rate investigation
found THREE real confounds hiding in exactly the fields this file was
missing -- sampling temperature (defaulted differently on each side),
input token distribution (assumed "same formula" was enough; it wasn't
precise enough for source-level reproducibility), and generation
depth/length (this workload's own `output_tokens` interacts with a REAL
acceptance-inflation effect for long unconstrained-greedy generation, see
`W1_S`/`W2_S` below). `Workload` now carries every field an acceptance-rate
or throughput comparison actually needs pinned: the exact tokenizer,
sampling parameters, stop semantics, and (for the synthetic `-S` line) a
path to FROZEN, VERSIONED prompt token ids -- not a regenerate-from-formula
scheme, which is reproducible but not precise (two runs using "the same
formula" can still diverge if `tokenizer.vocab_size`/`all_special_ids`
differ across environments/versions).

Two independent workload lines, per the coordinator's adopted "方案(c)":
- `*_S` (controlled synthetic, e.g. `W1_S`/`W2_S`): mechanism alignment,
  regression, fast debugging. Exact, frozen, versioned prompt token ids
  (see `PromptFixture`/`load_prompt_token_ids`) so both sides -- native
  vLLM and this project's own direct runtime -- are provably running the
  IDENTICAL input, not just "the same distribution." Explicitly NOT
  intended to answer "does this pass the acceptance-rate gate" by
  itself (see `W1_S`/`W2_S`'s own docstring below on the generation-depth
  caveat this line exists to isolate, not paper over).
- `*_R` (representative, e.g. `W1_R`/`W2_R`, NOT YET DEFINED -- design
  only this round, see notes/direct-model-runner-design.md): real
  programming-agent traffic replay, for the actual go/no-go acceptance
  decision. Per `项目实施规划.md`'s own original intent (confirmed
  consistent with the coordinator's framing): the formal gate is
  accepted-tokens/s + ITL + quality regression, NOT acceptance rate by
  itself -- acceptance rate is an explanatory intermediate metric for
  the `-S` line, never the final pass/fail criterion.
