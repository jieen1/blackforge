"""E1 Phase 2: Qwen3.6-27B MTP backend.

Extracted from DirectModelRunner -- contains all MTP (Multi-Token Prediction)
draft-model methods: forward primitives, sync/propose coordinators, and
high-level prefill/verify entry points.

The backend holds a reference to the runner (``self._r``) for accessing
shared infrastructure (KV caches, block pool, CUDA graphs, GDN state, etc.).
This is a deliberate composition choice: the MTP logic is model-specific
but depends on model-agnostic infrastructure that stays in the runner.

        (``mtp_prefill``/``mtp_verify_and_commit``) build on.

        ``prior_kv_len`` (2026-07-17 fix -- see below) is an EXPLICIT
        caller-supplied argument, NOT read from ``self._r.slot_draft_sync_len``
        internally as an earlier version of this method did. This method
        does NOT touch ``self._r.slot_draft_sync_len`` itself either way (the
        caller decides whether this call's advance represents the real
        synced history -- step 0, teacher-forced with the target's own
        just-computed hidden state -- or a throwaway exploratory propose
        step -- steps 1..K-1, autoregressive on the draft's own previous
        hidden state/token -- that must NOT be counted as committed). This
        is what makes the draft model's own KV cache need no explicit
        rollback on accept/reject, unlike GDN: an exploratory step's
        positions are simply overwritten by the next round's real sync
        call, exactly like attention's own content/position-addressed
        reasoning elsewhere in this file.

        **2026-07-17 real bug, caught by an independent Codex-sol review
        and independently re-verified by the coordinator before being
        relayed**: this method used to read ``prior_kv_len=self
        .slot_draft_sync_len[slot]`` directly. That field is deliberately
        NOT updated after step 0 (see above) -- correct for THAT field's
        job (tracking the real committed sync length across rounds), but
        WRONG when reused as this call's OWN attention-metadata history
        length for the exploratory loop's 2nd-and-later steps: those
        steps' actual physical write position (``start_pos``, which DOES
        advance every exploratory iteration in
        ``_mtp_sync_and_propose``) drifts away from the frozen
        ``slot_draft_sync_len``, so the attention metadata told the
        kernel a SMALLER history length than where the write actually
        landed -- the exploratory step's own query would then fail to
        attend to the PREVIOUS exploratory step's just-written K/V (it
        wasn't in the "prior" range the metadata declared), silently
        computing over an incomplete/wrong causal history for every
        exploratory step from the 2nd one onward. K=3 (this project's
        real production setting) has exactly 2 exploratory steps, so the
        1st (which happens to immediately follow step 0, where the frozen
        field and the real position still coincide) was fine, but the 2nd
        was not -- meaning every real K=3 proposal's 3rd draft token was
        computed against a subtly wrong causal history. Fixed by making
        the caller (``_mtp_sync_and_propose``) track its own LOCAL running
        prior-length counter that DOES advance every exploratory
        iteration, passed in here explicitly, while ``self
        .slot_draft_sync_len`` itself still only updates once (after step
        0) -- decoupling "what this call's attention needs" from "what the
        cross-round bookkeeping should remember" fixes both correctly at
        once. Not shape-checkable (see notes/direct-model-runner-design.md's
        2026-07-17 methodology-fix entry): this bug produced the right
        SHAPE and vocab-range output at every step, only the CONTENT was
        wrong from the 2nd exploratory step on -- exactly why the
        verification gradient's steps 3-4 (shape/length checks only) never
        caught it, and why the fix needed a per-step oracle-aligned logits
        comparison, not another shape check, to confirm.

        ``hidden_states_in`` must have exactly ``len(token_ids)`` rows
        (``Qwen3_5MultiTokenPredictor.forward()`` concatenates it against
        the embedded ``input_ids`` along the hidden-size dim, so the

        ``mtp_verify_and_commit_batch`` adopted in Phase 2, applied here at
        batch_size=1 -- instead of the old chunked-GDN-metadata +
        ``snapshot_gdn_state``/``restore_gdn_state`` + recompute-forward
        mechanism this method used through 2026-07-18. This was the last
        production call site of the old mechanism. ``snapshot_gdn_state``/
        ``restore_gdn_state`` are NOT deleted as a result: the falsifier
        check for this migration (before touching any code) confirmed
        ``benchmarks/mtp_gdn_rollback_check.py`` tests them directly as
        primitives (snapshot/restore around a real multi-step "detour",
        with no MTP verify call involved at all), and several other
        diagnostics (``mtp_real_draft_check.py``, ``mtp_trace_driven_probe.py``,
        ``mtp_slot_identity_pinpoint_diag.py``, ``mtp_batch_divergence_diag.py``,
        ``phase0_nsys_gap_ledger_diag.py``) call them directly too -- they
        remain in the codebase as tested, live (if no longer
        production-verify-path-connected) primitives. The old chunked
        ``verify_batch`` is retained for the same reason (still called
        directly by several diagnostics and by ``decode_batch``'s qo_len=1
        path via ``build_gdn_metadata_batch``).

        Why no accept/reject branch is needed any more (mirrors
        ``mtp_verify_and_commit_batch``'s own docstring): GDN's recurrent
        state, under the real spec-decode kernel, computes a causally-valid
        PER-POSITION output for every one of the K+1 candidate positions in
        a single verify forward, unconditionally -- only the recurrent
        STATE COMMIT (which physical row survives to be read next round) is
        acceptance-aware, via ``num_accepted_tokens``/``_ssm_spec_row``.
        This slot's hidden states for positions ``0..committed_len-1`` are
        therefore already sitting in ``verify_hidden``, correct, from the
        ONE verify forward this method issues -- a plain slice (never a
        second forward pass) is all the draft resync step needs, for a
        full accept exactly as much as for any partial reject.

        Persistent per-slot bookkeeping this method updates:
        ``self._r.slot_num_accepted_tokens[slot]`` (this slot's real committed
        length from ITS OWN last verify round, or bootstrap 1 right after a
        real ``mtp_prefill``) -- read by ``build_gdn_metadata_spec_batch``
        (via ``verify_batch_spec``) to select which of last round's K+1
        dedicated SSM rows holds the valid state to resume from.

        Recompute input alignment (2026-07-17, unchanged by this
        migration -- see notes/direct-model-runner-design.md): the token
        whose OWN K/V gets written at position ``kv_len_before + i`` is
        the i-th QUERY INPUT of the verify forward, matching
        ``verify_batch``/``verify_batch_spec``'s shared convention where
        ``draft[0]=anchor``'s K/V lands at ``kv_len_before`` (mirroring
        ``prefill()``/``decode()``'s established contract: the
        anchor/greedy-next token is NOT written into KV until it is fed
        back in as the FOLLOWING call's input). ``decision["committed"]``
        is ``[accepted_draft_0, ..., accepted_draft_{n-1}, recovery]`` --
        the recovery/bonus token is, symmetrically, NOT yet written into KV
        either (it becomes the next round's own anchor-equivalent). So the
        real input tokens for positions ``kv_len_before..+committed_len-1``
        are ``real_new_tokens = [anchor] + committed[:-1]`` (anchor +
        accepted drafts, dropping the not-yet-written recovery token) --
        NOT ``committed`` itself, which would silently write the WRONG
        token content into the KV cache while still looking correct on
        every shape/length/bookkeeping check.

        Draft catch-up + next-round propose, folded into ONE call
        (2026-07-17 multi-round design, unchanged by this migration): after
        committing, the draft's own KV is behind by exactly

        for the recompute-fallback batching round -- mirrors
        ``build_attention_metadata_batch``'s identical generalization,
        forwarded through as-is); a scalar broadcasts to a uniform list,
        so every existing call site is byte-for-byte unaffected.

        ``prior_kv_lens``/``start_pos_list`` are explicit per-slot lists,
        kept as TWO separate parameters (not collapsed into one) to mirror
        ``_mtp_forward``'s own explicit-argument design (its 2026-07-17 bug
        fix -- see that method's docstring): at every real call site in this
        file the two values coincide, but they mean different things
        (attention-metadata history length vs. physical write/embedding
        position) and collapsing them would silently re-introduce the same
        class of bug that fix addressed, just in the batched path instead
        of the single-slot one.

        ``token_ids`` is a flat list (one token id per slot, in ``slots``
        order) when ``qo_len`` is the literal scalar ``1``, or a list of
        per-slot token-id lists (each of length ``qo_len[i]``, possibly
        ragged) otherwise -- same convention ``_forward_batch`` uses.
        Returns logits/hidden_states shaped ``[sum(qo_lens), ...]`` in
        request-then-position order.

        ``logits_last_position_only`` (2026-07-18, D1-followup fix, default
        ``False`` preserving every existing call site byte-for-byte): same
        contract as ``_forward_batch``'s identical parameter -- when
        ``True``, BOTH the returned ``logits`` AND the returned
        ``hidden_states_out`` are gathered down to only each slot's own
        last position (shape ``[num_reqs, ...]``, not
        ``[sum(qo_lens), ...]``) before/after ``compute_logits``. Safe here
        specifically because ``_mtp_sync_and_propose_batch`` (this
        method's only caller) already discards every non-last-position row
        of both return values via its own ``index_select`` immediately
        after calling this method, for every existing call site -- so
        gathering earlier (before the vocab-head projection, instead of
        after) changes nothing observable except removing the wasted
        compute/memory. Only ``_mtp_sync_and_propose_batch``'s step-0 call
        passes this, and only when its own caller (``mtp_prefill_batch``)
        requests it -- see that call site.

        every listed slot, followed by ONE batched draft-sync+propose
        funnel (``_mtp_sync_and_propose_batch``).

        **2026-07-19, continuous-batching round (ragged-length prefill):**
        prompts no longer need the SAME length. Through this round, this
        method hard-asserted every slot's prompt was exactly the same
        length (true for the W1-S/W2-S frozen fixtures, but not for real
        async serving, where different requests genuinely arrive with
        different prompt lengths). This is now generalized -- see the
        ``elif is_uniform_len`` / ``else`` split in the body below -- by
        reusing the SAME per-slot-ragged ``qo_len``/``num_new_tokens`` LIST
        mechanism ``_forward_batch``/``_mtp_sync_and_propose_batch`` already
        built and verified for the 2026-07-17 recompute-fallback batching
        round (see their own docstrings: ``build_attention_metadata_batch``/
        ``build_gdn_metadata_batch`` already construct correct CSR/
        cu_seqlens-style metadata for a ragged per-request qo_len list; the
        general/chunked attention kernel this routes to is already
        documented, in ``vllm/v1/attention/backends/sm120_gqa.py``, as
        correct for "arbitrary mixed prefill+decode batches" -- ragged
        MULTI-REQUEST prefill lengths are exactly that kernel's designed use
        case, not new territory). No new kernel/metadata mechanism was
        needed for this -- confirmed by direct reading before writing this
        branch, the same discipline the chunking round below already
        established. Every EXISTING (uniform-length) caller takes the
        EXACT SAME code path as before, byte-for-byte (the ``elif
        is_uniform_len`` branch is the untouched pre-2026-07-19 code) --
        only a genuinely ragged batch exercises the new ``else`` branch.

        ``chunk_size`` is NOT YET generalized to ragged batches: the
        chunked loop below advances every slot's chunk boundary in
        lockstep from a single shared ``running_kv_len``/
        ``running_draft_len`` counter, which assumes uniform length by
        construction. Combining ragged lengths with ``chunk_size`` raises
        ``NotImplementedError`` with an explicit message rather than
        silently mis-chunking -- a precisely scoped, real follow-on (see
        ``notes/2026-07-18-session-review-and-next-steps.md`` section 21),
        not something this round needed: real async admission prompts are
        far short of the 8K+ context where chunking's memory benefit
        matters, so this is a deliberate scope boundary, not a gap in the
        common case.

        **2026-07-18, D1-followup fix**: both the target model's prefill
        forward and the draft model's step-0 sync forward now pass
        ``logits_last_position_only=True`` -- this method only ever reads
        each slot's OWN last-position logits (the anchor / first draft
        token), never any other position's, so projecting every position
        through the vocab head was 100% wasted work. Found by direct
        instrumentation (``benchmarks/mtp_prefill_batch_memory_diag.py``)
        of the exact c=4/16K-context shape
        ``notes/2026-07-18-session-review-and-next-steps.md`` section 12
        flagged as 4.85x slower than native and peaking at 99.2% of GPU
        memory: at that shape (``qo_len=16384``, ``concurrency=4``, vocab
        248320) EACH of the two ``compute_logits`` calls this method used
        to make allocated an unused ``[65536, 248320]`` bf16 tensor (31040
        MiB, ~30.3 GiB) of which only 4 rows were ever read -- ~60 GiB of
        pure waste, and the second such allocation (already competing with
        the first plus the model+KV-cache baseline for the remaining
        headroom) took 15.2s by itself, direct evidence of near-OOM
        allocator pressure compounding the waste. See that section's
        follow-up entry for the full before/after numbers.

        ``chunk_size`` (2026-07-19, chunked-prefill round, default ``None``
        preserving every existing call site byte-for-byte -- see
        ``notes/2026-07-18-session-review-and-next-steps.md`` section 19
        for the full design/verification writeup): when given, and the
        prompt is longer than ``chunk_size``, splits the single giant
        target-model-forward-then-draft-model-step-0-forward this method
        otherwise does into multiple sequential ``chunk_size``-token
        pieces, so no one ``model.forward()`` call ever processes more
        than ``chunk_size * len(slots)`` tokens at once -- the fix for the
        16K/32K-context near-OOM activation-memory scaling section 12-18
        already root-caused and quantified (peak transient working set
        scales with ``qo_len * concurrency``; chunking bounds ``qo_len``
        to ``chunk_size`` regardless of total prompt length). Matches
        native vLLM's own ``--max-num-batched-tokens=8192`` chunked-prefill
        convention by default (``_DEFAULT_PREFILL_CHUNK_SIZE`` below).

        Both attention's paged KV cache and GDN's recurrent
        ``conv_state``/``ssm_state`` carry over correctly across chunks of
        the SAME slot's own prefill with **no new mechanism** -- both were
        already fully general, just never exercised this way before
        (confirmed by direct reading, not assumed, before writing this):
        ``_forward_batch``'s existing ``kv_lengths``/``commit=True``
        parameters already make each chunk's attention forward a genuine
        paged-KV continuation of the previous chunk (the SM120 general/
        FP8-KV kernel's own module docstring, ``vllm/v1/attention/backends
        /sm120_gqa.py``, already documents itself as correct for "pure
        prefill, chunked-prefill continuation, and arbitrary mixed
        prefill+decode batches" -- chunking here is new USAGE of that
        kernel path, not new kernel work); and GDN's ``has_initial_state``
        (built from ``self._r.slot_gdn_initialized`` inside
        ``build_gdn_metadata_batch``) is already False only for a
        genuinely fresh slot and unconditionally set True at the end of
        EVERY ``_forward_batch`` call regardless of ``qo_len`` (see that
        method's last few lines) -- so chunk 1 of a fresh slot's prefill
        correctly gets ``has_initial_state=False`` (matching today's
        single-shot behavior) and chunk 2 onward correctly gets
        ``has_initial_state=True``, reading back exactly the
        conv/ssm-state row chunk 1's own forward pass wrote, with zero new
        code in either metadata builder. This is the SAME per-physical-slot
        flag every decode/verify round already relies on for
        cross-ROUND state continuity -- generalized here, for the first
        time, to WITHIN-one-prefill continuity.

        The draft model's own step-0 sync is chunked in lockstep with the
        target model (same chunk boundaries, each chunk's target hidden
        states fed into that SAME chunk's draft forward) -- the other
        piece ``notes/2026-07-18-session-review-and-next-steps.md`` section
        18.6 identified as genuinely unbuilt. Only the LAST chunk's
        anchor/step-0 draft token are ever read; the K-1 further
        autoregressive draft continuation steps after step 0 are
        unaffected (still one uniform, small ``qo_len=1`` loop) and reuse
        ``_mtp_run_continuation_steps`` -- the exact same, already-verified
        tail ``_mtp_sync_and_propose_batch`` itself uses."""

        A, same-round sharing; self-contained)", and sec 3.5/3.6).

        When ``enable_prefix_cache`` is on AND >=2 same-round requests share a
        token prefix of at least one full block, the shared prefix is computed
        ONCE and referenced by all siblings instead of being recomputed N
        times:

        1. Detect the common token prefix among the same-round admit batch by
           direct comparison (``_common_prefix_len``, cheap for <=4 requests).
        2. Prefill the group LEADER (``slots[0]``) over ``[0, Lc)`` -- where
           ``Lc`` is the block-aligned common-prefix length, capped at
           ``min(prompt_len) - 1`` so every request keeps >=1 suffix token to
           recompute for its own logits (sec 3.8) -- forcing a GDN checkpoint
           boundary there, then ``snapshot_gdn_state`` at ``Lc``.
        3. Continue-prefill the leader's own suffix ``[Lc, leader_len)`` and
           draft-sync the leader over its whole prompt (this writes the draft
           layer's KV for ``[0, Lc)`` into the same shared blocks -- the draft
           layer is in the attention group, sec 3.1).
        4. For each SIBLING: reference the leader's ``[0, Lc)`` attention
           blocks (``BlockPool.reference``, ``ref_cnt += 1``, all 17 attention
           layers share the one block-id namespace), ``restore_gdn_state`` the
           leader's snapshot (``allow_cross_slot=True``), set
           ``slot_draft_sync_len = Lc``, and continue-prefill ONLY the
           sibling's suffix ``[Lc, sibling_len)`` through the already-validated
           chunked-prefill continuation machinery (``_forward_batch`` with
           ``kv_lengths=[Lc]``/``commit``/``is_decode=False`` + the
           ``_mtp_sync_and_propose_batch`` draft funnel).

        No persistent hash index, no eviction -- the shared entry lives only
        for this one admission round (P3 builds the persistent cache). Reuses
        ONLY the P1 block-table/ref-counting substrate + the existing GDN
        snapshot primitive + the chunked-continuation path; nothing here is a
        parallel copy of those.

        **Rollback-safe / byte-identical-to-P1 gate**: with ``enable_prefix_
        cache`` off, OR fewer than 2 requests, OR a block-aligned common
        prefix shorter than ``min_shared_prefix_tokens`` (default
        ``block_size`` -- one full shareable block), this falls back to the
        exact ``mtp_prefill_batch`` path, byte-for-byte P1 behavior.

        Returns the same ``{slot: {"anchor": int, "draft_tokens": list[int]}}``

        """Batched analogue of ``mtp_verify_and_commit`` -- **Phase 2,
        2026-07-18 rewrite** (``notes/2026-07-17-post-ragged-round-next-steps.md``
        section 10/11): now uses the REAL spec-decode GDN mechanism
        (``verify_batch_spec`` / ``build_gdn_metadata_spec_batch`` /
        ``_ssm_spec_row``) instead of Phase 0-3's chunked-GDN-metadata +
        snapshot/restore + recompute-forward mechanism. This eliminates an
        entire class of extra work this function used to do on every
        partial-reject round (``benchmarks/mtp_batch_recompute_cost_diag.py``
        found that was 84.4% of real rounds, ~56% of round wall time):
        there is no more snapshot, no more restore, no more separate
        recompute forward pass, and (as a direct consequence) no more
        full-accept/recompute GROUP SPLIT at all -- every slot in this
        call, regardless of its own accept/reject outcome, is handled by
        the exact same code path below.

        Why one uniform code path is now correct (not just simpler): GDN's
        recurrent state, under the real spec-decode kernel
        (``fused_sigmoid_gating_delta_rule_update_kernel`` -- re-verified
        directly against source this round, see ``_ssm_spec_row``'s
        docstring), computes a causally-valid PER-POSITION output for
        every one of the K+1 candidate positions in a single verify
        forward, unconditionally, regardless of which candidates later
        turn out to be real -- exactly like attention already was
        (content/position-addressed, so a rejected position's KV is
        simply never read again). Only the recurrent STATE COMMIT (which
        physical row is read next round) is acceptance-aware, via
        ``num_accepted_tokens``/``_ssm_spec_row`` -- the per-position
        OUTPUT itself needs no rollback or recomputation. This means
        every slot's hidden states for positions ``0..committed_len-1``
        are already sitting in ``verify_hidden``, correct, from the ONE
        verify forward this method issues -- a straight ragged SLICE
        (never a second forward pass) is all the draft resync step needs,
        for full-accept slots (``committed_len == k+1``) exactly as much
        as for any partial-reject slot (``committed_len < k+1``).

        Persistent per-slot bookkeeping this round introduces:
        ``self._r.slot_num_accepted_tokens`` (this slot's real committed
        length from ITS OWN last verify round, or bootstrap 1 right after
        a real prefill) -- read by ``build_gdn_metadata_spec_batch`` to
        select which of last round's K+1 dedicated SSM rows holds the
        valid state to resume from, and updated here after every round.

        **2026-07-18, Phase 2 CUDA-graph reconciliation**: the verify
        forward now goes through a CUDA-graph replay
        (``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph``, via ``self._r._get_verify_graph``,
        rebuilt this round to fill its GDN metadata via the same
        spec-decode mechanism this method uses -- see that class's
        docstring) whenever ``self._r.enable_cudagraph`` is on AND this
        runner has enough spare slot capacity (``num_slots >= 2*len(slots)``).
        Falls back to the eager ``verify_batch_spec`` path -- correctly,
        not silently -- whenever the graph isn't available for this
        call's batch_size (``enable_cudagraph`` off, matching every
        existing correctness suite; or a caller's active-slot count isn't
        one this runner precaptured). Since Phase 2 removed the separate
        recompute forward entirely, there is only ONE verify-shaped
        forward per round now, always at ``qo_len=k+1`` -- unlike Phase 3's
        old recompute-forward-graph-reuse special case (which needed a
        DIFFERENT qo_len per ragged recompute group), this graph lookup is
        now always the exact same shape every round, for every slot.

        **2026-07-18, Phase B**: ``mtp_verify_and_commit`` (the
        singular/looped sibling) was, through this point, intentionally
        NOT migrated -- it used the old chunked + snapshot/restore +
        recompute-forward mechanism unconditionally. Phase B (see that
        method's own docstring) migrated it to this SAME spec-decode
        mechanism, applied at batch_size=1 -- both production verify paths
        now share one mechanism. ``snapshot_gdn_state``/``restore_gdn_state``
        remain in the codebase regardless (a falsifier check confirmed
        ``benchmarks/mtp_gdn_rollback_check.py`` and several other
        diagnostics test/use them directly, independent of either verify
        path), just no longer called from ANY production verify path.

        Returns a dict keyed by slot id, each value shaped exactly like
        ``mtp_verify_and_commit``'s own return dict (plus ``next_anchor``/
        ``next_draft_tokens``) -- the external contract is unchanged."""
