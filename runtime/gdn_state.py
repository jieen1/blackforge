        steps.md's section 8) instead of a blocking pageable D2H memcpy
        (89-117ms/round, per that doc's section 7). API/return shape is
        UNCHANGED (same dict keys, same per-layer ``(conv, ssm)`` tuple
        shape) -- callers (``restore_gdn_state``, and, at the time, both
        ``mtp_verify_and_commit``/``_batch``) did not need to change.

        **2026-07-18, Phase B**: neither production verify path
        (``mtp_verify_and_commit``/``_batch``) calls this method any more
        -- both migrated to the real spec-decode GDN mechanism (see
        ``mtp_verify_and_commit``'s docstring), under which state commit is
        acceptance-aware and no snapshot/restore is ever needed. This
        method is retained as a tested, standalone primitive: a falsifier
        check (before Phase B's migration) confirmed
        ``benchmarks/mtp_gdn_rollback_check.py`` tests it directly
        (independent of any MTP verify call), and several other
        diagnostics (``mtp_real_draft_check.py``, ``mtp_trace_driven_probe.py``,
        ``mtp_slot_identity_pinpoint_diag.py``, ``mtp_batch_divergence_diag.py``,
        ``phase0_nsys_gap_ledger_diag.py``) call it directly too.

        Tags the snapshot with the SOURCE slot id and this slot's current
        generation counter (``self._r.slot_gdn_snapshot_gen``, bumped on
        every snapshot) -- 2026-07-17 addition per Codex-sol's explicit
        ask for explicit per-slot state so a STALE snapshot (e.g. a caller
        accidentally holding on to one from two rounds ago) can never be
        restored by mistake; ``restore_gdn_state`` rejects a generation
        mismatch. The slot-id tag was added in a follow-up fix the same
        day: without it, a caller mistakenly restoring slot A's snapshot
        into slot B could still pass the generation check (both slots
        typically climb their OWN counters in lockstep in a symmetric
        multi-slot workload, so equal generation numbers say nothing about
        SLOT identity) -- ``restore_gdn_state`` now also rejects a
        slot-id mismatch. Also marks the snapshot ``__consumed__`` on a
        successful restore -- restoring the SAME snapshot object a second
        time now raises instead of silently succeeding (idempotent in
        this specific case since both restores would write the same
        bytes, but a caller path that restores twice by mistake is exactly
        the kind of latent bug this project's "no silent passes" standard

        snapshot is still rejected even though the underlying GPU buffer
