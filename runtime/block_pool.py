        leader's ``[0, Lc)`` attention blocks instead of recomputing them
        (``notes/prefix-cache-design.md`` sec 5, "P2 -- Fan-out fork", and
        sec 3.5 step 1: "touch each (ref_cnt += 1) for all 17 attention

        MTP draft) share ONE block-id namespace, so referencing the block
        ids once covers every layer's KV for those token positions.

        Mirror-image of ``free``'s bookkeeping (which decrements and only
        re-queues at ``ref_cnt == 0``): a referenced block stays out of the
        free queue until EVERY referencer has freed it, so a shared block is
        never handed to ``allocate`` while any slot still references it
        (INV9). Carries the SAME INV7/range guards as ``allocate``/``free``
        (refuse reserved ids ``< reserved`` and out-of-range ids), plus a
        not-currently-allocated guard -- referencing a ``ref_cnt == 0``
        block would resurrect a block that may already be back in the free
        queue (and thus handed to another slot), an immediate aliasing bug.
