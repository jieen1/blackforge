class CapturedBatchDecodeGraph:
    """CUDA-graph-captured batch decode/verify for a FIXED batch size and
    FIXED ``qo_len`` (1 = pure decode, >1 = MTP/speculative-decode verify,
    e.g. 4 for K=3 draft + 1 bonus token), replayable at ANY per-slot
    kv_len up to this runtime's per-slot capacity (``blocks_per_slot *
    block_size``) -- not just whatever dummy shape was used at capture
    time.

    2026-07-16, CUDA Graph round: this project's own read of
    ``vllm/v1/attention/backends/sm120_gqa.py``'s documented history (a
    real illegal-memory-access crash, root-caused to metadata tensors
    without fixed addresses) plus its OTHER documented lesson
    (``kv_split_size``/``max_num_splits`` frozen at capture time going
    stale under a later, larger real kv_len) directly motivate this
    class's two central design points:

    1. Every tensor a captured kernel launch reads (metadata CSR tensors,
       input_ids, positions, slot_mapping) is a PERSISTENT, fixed-address
       buffer, allocated once in ``__init__``. ``replay()`` writes freshly
       computed REAL values into these SAME buffers via ``.copy_()`` --
       it never reallocates them. This is what makes replaying at a
       kv_len the buffers were never filled with at capture time safe.
    2. ``kv_split_size``/``max_num_splits`` are derived ONCE from this
       runtime's configured per-slot page-table limit (``blocks_per_slot *
       block_size`` -- a software ceiling the caller chose when
       constructing ``DirectModelRunner``, NOT a GPU hardware limit), via
       ``build_attention_metadata_batch``'s ``fixed_kv_split_size``/
       ``fixed_max_num_splits`` parameters -- see that function's
       docstring for the correctness proof that this bounds every real
       kv_len up to that configured limit, not just the capture-time
       value.

    2026-07-16, MTP extension (qo_len>1), **superseded 2026-07-18 (Phase 2
    CUDA-graph reconciliation)**: originally this replicated GDN's
    chunked/"prefill" metadata (``build_gdn_metadata_batch``'s
    ``chunk_indices``/``chunk_offsets``/``nums_dict``/``batch_ptr``/
    ``token_chunk_offset_ptr``/``has_initial_state`` fields), matching
    what the eager verify path did at the time. The eager path has since
    moved to the REAL spec-decode GDN mechanism
    (``build_gdn_metadata_spec_batch`` -- K+1 dedicated SSM rows,
    acceptance-aware addressing, no snapshot/restore/recompute-forward;
    see ``mtp_verify_and_commit_batch``'s docstring) for the exact same
    reason this class exists at all: qo_len>1 here ONLY ever means MTP
    verify. This class now mirrors that mechanism instead:
    ``spec_query_start_loc``/``spec_sequence_masks`` are CONSTANT for a
    fixed (batch_size, qo_len) pair (computed once, same reasoning as
    ``qo_indptr`` above); ``spec_state_indices_tensor`` (a FIXED
    per-(slot, column) row mapping by construction -- see
    ``_ssm_spec_row`` -- but slot IDENTITY varies per replay, since one
    graph object is reused across calls with different active slot sets
    at the same batch_size) and ``num_accepted_tokens`` (the real
    per-round accept/reject outcome, inherently different every replay)
    are both refilled in ``_fill_buffers`` every replay, exactly like
    ``kv_page_indices``/``state_indices`` already were.

    A replayed CUDA graph is a pre-recorded sequence of GPU kernel
    launches, NOT a re-execution of Python control flow -- ``model
    .forward()`` (the Python function) is only ever actually called
    during ``capture()`` (plus its warmup iterations), never during
    ``replay()``. This means whatever kernel-dispatch branch
    ``SM120GQAImpl.forward()`` takes (decode-kernel vs general, FP8 vs
    NVFP4, MMA vs v2 vs scalar, ...) must be identical for every real
    kv_len this graph will ever replay at -- true here because dispatch
    depends only on ``qo_len``/kv-cache dtype/model config, all fixed for
    a given (batch_size, qo_len) graph, never on the live kv_len itself.

    2026-07-17, state-neutral capture (correctness fix, found via an
    independent review this project's coordinator commissioned and
    personally verified): ``capture()``'s warmup runs 3 REAL executions
    on a side stream before the graph trace (the trace itself, inside
    ``with torch.cuda.graph(g):``, executes nothing -- confirmed against
    the sibling project's own kernel-level CUDA-graph test). Attention's
    paged KV cache tolerates redundant warmup writes fine (same position,
    same value, overwritten harmlessly) -- but GDN's recurrent/chunked
    state update reads-old-state-and-writes-new-state each call, so it is
    NOT idempotent under repeated identical input; running warmup against
    slots a caller will later actually replay against silently advances
    those slots' real GDN state by 3 extra (unaccounted, un-bookkept)
    applications before any real replay happens. This was a genuine gap
    in this project's own initial qo_len=1/MTP test scripts (both reused
    real/twin-established slots for warmup) -- their empirical PASS
    results are not proof this doesn't matter, only evidence it didn't
    surface for that specific signal-probe task (plausibly because
    full-attention layers dominate identity recall, masking a GDN
    perturbation a GDN-sensitive task might not tolerate).

    Fix: this class now reserves ``batch_size`` of the runner's logical
    slots PERMANENTLY for its own exclusive, disposable warmup use (the
    LAST ``batch_size`` slots of ``runner.num_slots`` -- see
    ``self._warmup_slots``) -- ``capture()`` takes no external slot/token/
    kv_length arguments at all anymore, so this can no longer depend on
    caller discipline the way the original design implicitly did. Callers
    must size ``runner.num_slots >= 2 * batch_size`` and never pass this
    graph's reserved warmup slots to ``replay()`` or any other runner
    method.

    Also fixed the same round: ``replay()`` no longer calls
    ``torch.cuda.synchronize()`` (see that method's docstring for why this
    is safe and why the removed blanket device-wide sync worked against
    the whole point of using a captured graph to cut CPU-side dispatch
    overhead), and ``_fill_buffers`` now computes per-replay values via
    plain Python arithmetic instead of round-tripping through
    ``build_attention_metadata_batch``/``build_gdn_metadata_batch``/
    ``DirectModelRunner._slot_mapping_batch`` (which each construct several
    of their own intermediate GPU tensors -- real, avoidable per-replay
    allocation overhead on what should be a lean hot path). This is a
    partial mitigation (each static buffer's ``.copy_()`` source is still
    a freshly constructed small tensor, not a persistent pinned staging
    buffer written in place) -- a fully allocation-free version is a
    further optimization, not attempted this round.

        parameter of the same name on the eager path.

        mirrors ``_forward_batch``'s own ``commit`` parameter -- this
        method used to advance ``self.runner.slot_kv_len`` by
        ``self.qo_len`` UNCONDITIONALLY, the exact physical-write-vs-
        committed conflation already fixed on the eager path (see
        ``_forward_batch``'s docstring) but left inconsistent here, since
        this class has its own separate captured-graph call path that
        never goes through ``_forward_batch``. For ``qo_len==1`` (plain
        decode) this default is harmless (never ambiguous). For
        ``qo_len>1`` (MTP verify), the caller (``mtp_verify_and_commit_batch``,
        2026-07-18) passes ``commit=False`` and applies the real
        committed-length correction itself (plus updates
        ``slot_num_accepted_tokens`` for the NEXT round) after determining
        accept/reject on the returned logits -- exactly like the eager
        ``verify_batch_spec`` path.

        and ``self._graph.replay()`` are all issued on the SAME (default)
        CUDA stream, so CUDA's own stream-ordering already guarantees the
        graph's kernels observe the freshly-copied buffer contents, and
        that the NEXT call's ``_fill_buffers`` won't overwrite data this
        replay is still reading -- no explicit device-wide sync is needed
        for that. The caller gets an implicit, narrowly-scoped sync for
        free the moment it actually reads back a value (e.g.
        ``.argmax(dim=-1).item()`` on the returned logits). A blanket
        ``torch.cuda.synchronize()`` here would additionally block on any
        OTHER unrelated work queued on the device -- directly working

    Phase 3 candidate 1: "then the K draft steps") -- generalized from an
    initial qo_len=1-only version (same day, same round) once it became
    clear step 0 is ALSO uniform-shaped often enough to be worth capturing,
    exactly mirroring how ``mtp_verify_and_commit_batch``'s recompute
    forward reuses ``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph`` for its own uniform special
    case (see that method's comment) -- this class is the draft-model
    analogue of that same idea, generalized in place rather than as a
    parallel copy.

    Narrower than ``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph`` in two ways, both because
    the draft model's own call shape is simpler than the target model's:
    1. No GDN metadata at all -- ``runner.mtp_attn_layer_names`` never
       includes a GDN layer (the draft model registers only its own small
       full-attention layer(s); see ``DirectModelRunner.__init__``).
    2. Takes an EXTRA static input, ``static_hidden_states_in`` (shape
       ``[batch_size*qo_len, hidden_size]``), since ``Qwen3_5MultiTokenPredictor
       .forward()`` needs the running hidden-state carry between steps
       that the target model's own ``forward()`` does not.

    Always dispatches via ``decode_qo_len=qo_len``/``is_pure_decode=(qo_len==1)``
    (the fast decode/verify kernel path) regardless of what the EAGER path
    would have used for the same call -- for step 0 specifically, the eager
    ``_mtp_forward_batch`` passes ``is_decode=all(n==1 for n in
    num_new_tokens_list)``, which is ``False`` whenever ``qo_len>1``,
    routing eager step-0 calls through the general/chunked attention
    kernel instead. This is a DELIBERATE dispatch difference, not a bug:
    the underlying math (causal attention over a query range against a KV
    cache) is identical either way -- this project's own
    ``build_attention_metadata_batch`` docstring already establishes that
    the decode-kernel and general-kernel paths are numerically
    equivalent, just different kernel choices -- and using the fast
    decode/verify kernel here is a legitimate additional (small) win on
    top of the graph-capture win itself. Verified via
    ``benchmarks/mtp_verify_cudagraph_check.py``'s real content comparison
    against an independent eager reference, not assumed.

    Stateless w.r.t. runner bookkeeping: unlike ``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph
    .replay()``, this class's ``replay()`` does NOT touch
    ``runner.slot_kv_len``/``slot_gdn_initialized`` at all -- mirroring
    ``_mtp_forward_batch`` itself, which also never does (the caller
    tracks its own running length counters as plain local Python
    variables, not persistent per-slot runner state). ``prior_kv_len ==
    start_pos`` always holds for every real call site in this codebase
    (confirmed by inspection: ``_mtp_sync_and_propose_batch`` always
    derives ``start_pos_list`` from the exact same ``slot_draft_sync_len``
    snapshot its own internal ``prior_kv_lens_step0`` uses, and the
    qo_len=1 continuation loop advances both counters by the same amount
    every iteration), so this class only needs ONE per-slot length list,
    not two.

    Same warmup-slot-reservation and state-neutral-capture discipline as
    ``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph`` (see that class's docstring for the full
    rationale): the last ``batch_size`` logical slots of ``runner.num_slots``
    are reserved, used only by this graph's own ``capture()``, and reset
    immediately afterward. Warmup content is fully disposable (a dummy
    all-zeros hidden-state tensor and dummy token ids) -- the draft
    model's own attention KV is content/position-addressed like the
    target model's, so redundant warmup writes are harmless, and there is
    no GDN-style non-idempotent recurrent state in this class's scope at
    all (point 1 above), so the correctness concern that motivated
    ``CapturedBatchDecodeGraph``'s state-neutral-capture fix does not even
    apply here -- reserved slots are used anyway, for consistency with the
    established pattern and so a caller can safely reuse the SAME
    physical reserved-slot range across both graph classes (each resets
    its own warmup slots right after its own ``capture()``)."""
