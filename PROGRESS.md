# Implementation Progress

Updated: 2026-07-15

## Completed

### Phase 0 — Baseline contract

- Frozen W1 (4K input / 1K output) and W2 (32K / 1K) workloads for
  concurrency 1 and 4.
- Added the baseline record template in `notes/phase-0-baseline.md`.
- Verified CUDA execution on RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (SM120) with
  PyTorch 2.11.0+cu130.

### Phase 1 — Correctness oracle

- Added golden fixture definitions, numerical comparison metrics, and a
  read-only PyTorch forward-hook capture utility.
- Oracle captures are detached to CPU and can be saved as safetensors without
  modifying the local, dirty `~/vllm` checkout.

### Phase 2 — Loader and packing prerequisites

- Validated the Unsloth NVFP4 checkpoint: 5 shards, 1,968 indexed tensors,
  168 packed NVFP4 tensors, and matching safetensors headers/scales.
- Added config validation for the 64-layer topology: 16 full-attention and
  48 GDN layers.
- Added on-demand, index-directed tensor reading; no full checkpoint load is
  performed by metadata tools.

### Phase 3 — Eager control plane

- Implemented fixed four-slot lifecycle management, hybrid KV/GDN cache
  metadata, and prefill/decode request control flow.
- All slots retain stable logical addresses; release/reset increments the slot
  generation to prevent stale state reuse.

## Verification

- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q`: 27 passed.
- `./.venv/bin/ruff check .`: passed.
- `./.venv/bin/python tools/verify_cuda.py`: SM120 CUDA tensor smoke test
  passed.

## Environment and Current State

- Project-local `.venv` contains the CUDA runtime, PyTorch, safetensors, and
  vLLM Python dependencies. It is ignored by Git.
- A separately managed `~/.venvs/vllm` runs local vLLM `0.25.1.dev0` when
  needed. Do not modify its source checkout.
- A temporary vLLM oracle server was stopped; no vLLM process is active.

## Next Work

1. Capture real vLLM layer/GDN/logit fixtures only when GPU capacity is
   available.
2. Implement the offline SM120 NVFP4 packing layout after fixing the target
   CUTLASS/CUDA layout contract.
3. Connect the eager engine to model operators, then validate prefill and
   continuous decode against oracle fixtures.
