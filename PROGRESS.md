# Implementation Progress

Updated: 2026-07-15

## Completed

### Phase 0 — Baseline contract

- Frozen W1 (4K input / 1K output) and W2 (32K / 1K) workloads for
  concurrency 1 and 4.
- Added the baseline record template in `notes/phase-0-baseline.md`.
- Verified CUDA execution on RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (SM120) with
  PyTorch 2.11.0+cu130.

### Phase 1 — Correctness oracle

- Added golden fixture definitions, numerical comparison metrics, and a
  read-only PyTorch forward-hook capture utility.
- Oracle captures are detached to CPU and can be saved as safetensors without
  modifying the local, dirty `~/vllm` checkout.

### Phase 2 — Loader and packing prerequisites

- Validated the Unsloth NVFP4 checkpoint: 5 shards, 1,968 indexed tensors,
  168 packed NVFP4 tensors, and matching safetensors headers/scales.
- Added config validation for the 64-layer topology: 16 full-attention and
  48 GDN layers.
- Added on-demand, index-directed tensor reading; no full checkpoint load is
  performed by metadata tools.

### Phase 3 — Eager control plane

- Implemented fixed four-slot lifecycle management, hybrid KV/GDN cache
  metadata, and prefill/decode request control flow.
- All slots retain stable logical addresses; release/reset increments the slot
  generation to prevent stale state reuse.

### Phase 3 continued — first real (non-mock) model backend

- Added `runtime/vllm_bridge_backend.py`: the first real `prefill`/`decode`
  `OpRegistry` implementation. It does not yet drive model layers directly
  (see "Real scope of this bridge" below) -- it drives the real
  `unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4` checkpoint (16 full-attention + 48 GDN layers)
  through a real, isolated vLLM server (the same
  `sm120-flash-attention/vllm_integration/launch_test_server.py` this
  machine already uses for kernel validation) over its OpenAI-compatible
  HTTP API. This matches `项目实施规划.md`'s own phased-rollout intent:
  "每个算子最开始可以调用 vLLM/FlashInfer/torch，之后逐个替换成自研 kernel."
- Added `benchmarks/real_forward_smoke.py`, a live-server integration script
  (not part of `pytest -q` -- AGENTS.md's testing guideline says unit tests
  must not require downloading weights or a live server) covering:
  1. single prefill + short decode,
  2. continuous generation (tested at 48 tokens; contention-bounded, see
     below -- the mechanism is identical at any length),
  3. four real concurrent requests (capacity=4) with distinct marker codes,
     checking each recovers only its own code,
  4. release one of four slots, submit a new request, confirm the freed
     physical slot is reused with `generation + 1` and produces the new
     request's own content with zero leakage from any prior occupant (the
     vLLM issue #37554 class of risk this project's root CLAUDE.md flags:
     stale GDN dummy-forward state leaking into a reused slot).
- All four ran against the real model on 2026-07-15 and passed:
  ```
  1) "The capital of France is" -> " Paris...\nThat is correct. Paris is the
     capital and largest" -- PASS
  2) 48 real tokens generated, coherent text -- PASS
  3) slot-0.."falcon-9182", slot-1.."harbor-3305", slot-2.."cinder-7716",
     slot-3.."meridian-6640" -- each recovered only its own code, zero
     cross-slot leakage -- PASS
  4) freed slot_id=0 reused with generation 0->1; new request recovered its
     own code "thistle-5540" with zero leakage from any of the four prior
     occupants' codes -- PASS
  ```
- Decode v2 (this machine's fastest attention kernel, `+8.6%` over native
  FlashInfer end-to-end in `sm120-flash-attention`) was exercised for real:
  the server was launched with `SM120_GQA_USE_V2_DECODE_KERNEL=1` and
  `SM120GQABackend` registered under `--attention-backend CUSTOM`, confirmed
  from the server log (`registered AttentionBackendEnum.CUSTOM ->
  ...sm120_gqa.SM120GQABackend`, once for the parent, once for the spawned
  EngineCore child). Prefill v2 is not yet wired into `SM120GQABackend` as of
  this run (confirmed via `git log` on the other project before starting --
  only decode v2 is registered there), so prefill still used the old kernel;
  re-run once prefill v2 lands there.

#### Real scope of this bridge (what it does and does not prove)

This is a deliberate, honestly-scoped first increment, not the full Phase 3
target from `项目实施规划.md`. What it proves: the control plane
(`EagerEngine`/`HybridCache`/`FixedSlotManager`) drives a **real** 64-layer
hybrid model correctly through prefill, decode, continuous generation, and
slot release/reuse, with no mocks anywhere in the loop. What it does **not**
yet do: our `HybridCache` does not own the physical GPU KV/GDN state
addresses -- vLLM's own engine still owns those internally. Getting there
requires extracting vLLM's `Qwen3_5Model`/`qwen_gdn_linear_attn.py` layers
(`vllm/model_executor/models/qwen3_5.py`, 642 lines;
`vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/gdn/qwen_gdn_linear_attn.py`, 1828 lines)
and driving their `forward()` directly against our own slot-addressed
buffers, bypassing vLLM's scheduler/`KVCacheManager`/`Mamba2Metadata`
construction entirely. No existing vLLM test or example does this at real
model scale (checked `tests/model_executor/test_qwen3_5_quantization.py`:
mocked-config unit tests only, not a real-weights harness) -- this is real,
substantial follow-on engineering, not a short next step. Also not yet done:
`--return-tokens-as-token-ids` (the bridge currently reconstructs token ids
locally via `transformers` tokenizer round-trip on `max_tokens=1` text
fragments -- correct in every run observed today, but see the design note in
`vllm_bridge_backend.py` for the residual BPE-boundary risk).

#### Cross-fork GPU contention encountered and root-caused

Requests intermittently stalled 12-27s (a single-token completion should be
near-instant). Root-caused to a **different, parallel task in the sibling
`sm120-flash-attention` project** running `compute-sanitizer --tool
memcheck` against its own kernel test (`test_prefill_v2_paged.py`) on the
same single GPU -- `compute-sanitizer` is well known to serialize/slow GPU
access 10-50x, and this machine has exactly one GPU. Not a bug in this
runtime or the bridge. The isolated test server (port 8100) was stopped
(`stop_test_server.py`, confirmed via
`nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps` returning empty) immediately after the
four correctness checks passed, to free the GPU for that other task's own
decisive benchmark -- **nsys full-model time-breakdown (attention/GDN/NVFP4
GEMM/launch-gap attribution) was deferred for this reason** and needs a
dedicated GPU window (a fresh `nsys launch`-wrapped server start; nsys
cannot attach retroactively to an already-running server).

## Verification

- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q`: 27 passed.
- `./.venv/bin/ruff check .`: passed.
- `./.venv/bin/python tools/verify_cuda.py`: SM120 CUDA tensor smoke test
  passed.
- `./.venv/bin/python -m benchmarks.real_forward_smoke`: all 4 real-server
  checks passed (2026-07-15, see above).

## Environment and Current State

- Project-local `.venv` contains the CUDA runtime, PyTorch, safetensors, and
  vLLM Python dependencies. It is ignored by Git.
- A separately managed `~/.venvs/vllm` runs local vLLM `0.25.1.dev0` when
  needed. Do not modify its source checkout.
- No vLLM process is currently active (isolated test server stopped after
  this round's verification; GPU confirmed free via
  `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps`).
- Added `requests`/`transformers` as an optional `serving` dependency group
  in `pyproject.toml` for the bridge backend and smoke script.

## Next Work, in priority order (real time/complexity estimate per item)

1. **nsys full-model time breakdown** (deferred this round for GPU
   contention, see above) -- relaunch the isolated test server wrapped in
   `nsys launch --trace=cuda,osrt`, drive one representative decode/MTP step
   through `real_forward_smoke.py`, and attribute time to
   attention/GDN/NVFP4 GEMM/launch-gap per `项目实施规划.md`'s Phase 0 gate.
   Small effort once GPU is free (~15-30 min).
2. **Own the physical GPU KV/GDN state addresses directly** (the real
   remaining Phase 3 target) -- extract vLLM's `Qwen3_5Model` and
   `qwen_gdn_linear_attn.py` layer modules and drive their `forward()`
   directly against our `HybridCache`'s slot-addressed buffers, replacing
   today's HTTP bridge. This is substantial (multi-session) engineering, not
   a quick follow-on -- see "Real scope of this bridge" above for the exact
   files and why no existing vLLM harness shortcuts it.
3. **Wire prefill v2 in** once it lands in `SM120GQABackend` on the
   sibling project (only decode v2 is registered there as of this round).
4. Re-run `real_forward_smoke.py`'s continuous-generation check at the full
   256-1000 token range once (1) or (2) removes the current bridge's
   per-step full-HTTP-roundtrip cost (today's design re-sends the whole
   growing prefix as text each step; prefix caching should make this cheap
   GPU-side, but the Python/HTTP/tokenizer overhead per call is real and
   was not separately measured this round).
