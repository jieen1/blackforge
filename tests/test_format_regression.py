"""Regression tests built from REAL captured client requests.

These lock two classes of bug that have actually hit this service so they
cannot recur silently:

1. Format parsing drops the user's message. The original Claude Desktop report
   ("the model didn't get my message") is guarded by asserting that every real
   request body's user content survives ``parse_messages`` /
   ``parse_chat_messages`` intact.

2. Long-context requests wrongly rejected. That same Claude Desktop report was
   ACTUALLY a capacity rejection: prompt_tokens(25843) + max_tokens(64000) =
   89843 exceeded the old 67200-token per-slot cap (blocks_per_slot=4200). The
   service now runs blocks_per_slot=16384 (256K). These tests assert the real
   numbers pass the 256K cap and would have failed the old 67K cap.

CPU-only: no GPU, no running server, no tokenizer required (runs in CI).
Fixtures live in ``tests/fixtures/`` (see the README.md there). When a new real
client request exposes a bug, capture its RAW REQUEST line from the service log
and add it verbatim as a fixture, then add a case here.
